# Nicholas Alexander's PhD dissertation

This repository contains some pre-processed data and the statistical routines used in my PhD dissertation. This work has been [successfully defended on July, 13th, 2015](https://www.bumc.bu.edu/gms/files/2015/07/Defense-Schedule-Abstract-Sandor-Nicolae.pdf).

The raw data, including high quality immunoblot images, has been available as raw files (txt, tiff, csv and so on) on an institutional Google Drive until June 2024, when Boston University discontinued Google Drive storage services for alumni. I am not aware of any free storage for 16 GB worth of data, especially not the kind that will carry the seal of authenticity the way Google Drive had provided. The repository name, file names, and owner name have changed over time, in particular in the 2014-2015 period when the content was actually created, and again during a reorg, in mid-2020. There may be some unfixable link rot.

The purpose of this work is to communicate scientific findings and hypotheses to medicine and biology specialists.
