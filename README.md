# Nicholas Alexander's PhD dissertation

This repository contains the pre-processed data and the statistical routines used in my PhD dissertation. The raw data, including high quality immunoblot images, may be available as raw files (txt, tiff, csv and so on), at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gjjwNYiVufZIanVU1UcWIiIEXCKbFfvX?usp=sharing . Unfortunately, Boston University will discontinue Google Drive storage services during spring of 2024, and I am not aware of any free storage for 16 GB worth of data.

The repository name, file names, and owner name have changed over time, in particular in the 2014-2015 period when the content was actually created, and again in a reorg in mid-2020. There may be some unfixable link rot. 

The main text of the dissertation and selected raw or processed data are registered with ProQuest under a Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY-NC-ND) license, and with the US Copyright Register.

The purpose of this work is to communicate scientific findings and hypotheses to medicine and biology specialists. Biomedical science is a fast-changing field, meaning that the content of this publication may be outdated and superseded by subseqent studies and publications. No part of this publication should be used in place of professional medical advice.
