Skeletal muscle histology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Muscles are specialized for their main ability, contractility.
 For mammalians, ability to move is vital for survival, meaning that a large
 portion of their bodies is muscle.
 In a cohort of 300 borderline overweight US Americans, skeletal muscle
 as a proportion of body weight was on average 41% for men and 31% for women
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

.
 Owing to the ability to measure individual muscles in any experiment, the
 scientific community has not been under pressure to develop accurate techniques
 that measure total skeletal muscle mass in mice.
 A proxy measure of murine skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass averaged
 81% of total body weight in adult males (detailed in results section).
 Three fifths of the human body's protein is confined to the muscle contractile
 and support structures

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, the skeletal muscles confers the three-dimensional intricate
 conformation of the body, suggesting a complex, detailed organization,
 at least at macroscopic level.
 In contrast, at cell level, the relatively high specialization of the skeletal
 muscle leaves little space for diversity or inhomogeneity.
 Skeletal muscles are organized in anatomical units that may impose a force
 on two moving body segments (typically, bones), determining them to come
 closer to each other.
 This specificity of action is ensured by the presence of distinct, well-determi
ned insertion points, to which skeletal muscles are attached by the means
 of tendons and aponeuroses (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mescher2013junqueiras"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tendons are dense connective tissue structure, which extend into the
 epimysium, a connective tissue sheath surrounding the muscle.
 In turn, epimysium emits connective septing structures termed perimysium,
 splitting muscles into subunits termed fascicles.
 At an even lower level, a thin, sparse connective structure called endomysium
 coats each polynucleate, elongated cell (termed myofiber).
 Connective tissue supports the terminal branches of the nervous, circulatory
 and lymphatic systems.
 In addition, connective tissue inside the muscle provides mechanical anchoring
 between fibers, longitudinally, laterally and with the tendons.
 This is particularly true of perimysium, whose collagen content is 95%
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "light1984characterization"

\end_inset

.
 The collagen in muscle-associated connective tissue is mainly of types
 I and III (reticulin), with traces of type V collagen and fibronectin,
 while the most frequent proteoglycan is collagen I-binding decorin
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "eggen1994decorin"

\end_inset

.
 The external lamina is the equivalent of basement membranes in other tissues,
 an proteic structure surrounding each multinucleate, roughly tubular cell.
 The external lamina contains collagen IV, laminin, and heparan sulfates
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "grounds2005strength,mann2011aberrant"

\end_inset

.
 Muscle mass changes should require remodeling of all these connective structure
s, with novel collagen synthesis possibly misleading measurements of protein
 synthesis in atrophying muscle.
 In addition to the contractile and connective components, muscles include
 vascular, nervous, adipose, blood and immune cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The myofiber is the histological base unit of contractile tissue.
 Another muscle-specific population of cells comprises the mononuclear,
 proliferating cells, called satellite cells.
 Satellite cells are nearly devoid of cytosol, sitting in close proximity
 to the fiber, under the external lamina.
 They can be identified by markers such as Pax7 and, on the membrane, CD34
 (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each myofiber is a syncytium, that forms and grows by fusion with neighboring
 cells.
 The only way to acquire nuclei to the myofibers is fusion with surrounding
 proliferative mononucleate cells, or with neighboring myofibers.
 Cells that have the ability to undergo mitosis and to fuse with myofibers
 are typically designated myoblasts.
 In vivo, myoblasts are derived from a subset of satellite cells.
 Experimentally, α7 integrin is an effective marker for selecting proliferative
 precursors from muscle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "blanco-bose2001purification"

\end_inset

, although its sensitivity and specificity are yet to be established.
 Alternate sources of nuclei in the myofiber are subject of ongoing research,
 but their relative importance is expected to be minor at best (reviewed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A transplant of seven satellite cells from an adult mouse is capable of
 yielding more than a hundred multinucleate myofibers, thus demonstrating
 former's ability to regenerate muscle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 The transformation of quiescent satellite cells to proliferating myoblast
 is regulated by the interplay of growth factors, external lamina, and contact
 with myofibers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bischoff1986proliferation"

\end_inset

.
 In vivo, myofiber nuclei are typically peripheral, while in vitro incomplete
 models often yield elongated, contractile cells, with central nuclei, akin
 to regenerating fibers.
 The latter are typically termed myotubes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proliferative niche can play an important role in muscle atrophy and
 recovery.
 However, muscle hypertrophy may occur without cell divisions.
 For example, the muscles of mice receiving clenbuterol and of rats undergoing
 eccentric training gain 20-30% muscle mass without apparent DNA changes

 Quail muscles depleted of proliferating cells by irradiation still undergo
 hypertrophy in response to stretch-overload
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 These example of amitotic hypertrophy demonstrate that, in some circumstances,
 the number of nuclei and the pace of transcription are not limiting factors
 in muscle growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large majority of the myofiber cytosol is the contractile apparatus, in
 the shape of bundles of protein filaments termed myofibrils.
 Within myofibrils, myosin and actin filaments alternate, held together
 by multi-protein complexes containing titin.
 Myofibril proteins are about two thirds of the total myofiber protein
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "waterlow1978protein"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, any myofiber size change with functional relevance should correlate
 with changes in myosin II and actin protein content.
 In rat muscles, three days of streptozotocin-induced acute diabetes causes
 intramuscular formation of a actin degradation fragment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "du2004activation"

\end_inset

.
 The apparent sensitivity of actin to muscle mass regulators poses a technical
 challenge to protein and even mRNA measurements, because traditionally
 actin is considered a housekeeping, unregulated, and rather constant protein,
 and is used in level normalization.
 If, in an atrophying muscle, some protein of interest is depleted faster
 than actin, immunoblots will convey the certainty that the former is downregula
ted.
 But if the protein of interest is lost in a less preferential manner, at
 the same rate with actin, immunoblots normalized to actin will convey the
 mistaken appearance of constancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar issues govern the use of 3MH as a marker for myofibril protein catabolis
m.
 Given that the main correlate of urinary 3MH is muscle mass
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lukaski1981relationship"

\end_inset

, 3MH measurement may lack sensitivity when used as a indicator for muscle
 catabolic rate.
 On one hand, increased catabolism is expected to cause increased 3MH output,
 but on the other, an atrophic muscle has less 3MH to release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During experiments that perturb muscle mass equilibrium, the level of the
 regulators, of typical housekeeping proteins, and of non-myofiber proteins
 may fluctuate in manners that convolve their specific modulation with overall
 muscle protein kinetics.
 Investigation of recovery from muscle loss is burdened by the fact that
 it aims to dissect protein regulation, when the regulators are proteins
 themselves.

Preadult muscle development

Around puberty, muscle growth is associated with a massive shift of nuclei
 from the satellite cells to the myofibers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Even earlier, de novo muscle development is remarkable for its accretion
 of new nuclei to the myofiber.
 Pre-adulthood muscle growth appears reliant on hyperplasia, that is, cell
 proliferation.
 Cell proliferation regulators are crucial in determination of muscle mass
 in before and soon after birth.
\end_layout

In utero, the mesoderm, which is the source of muscle progenitor cells,
 undergoes segmentation and differentiation to form somites, dermomyotomes,

 In the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (

) database, there is no reported case of human mutation of Myf5 or MyoD,
 further supporting the idea of duplicate function.
 Neither Myf5, nor MyoD induce muscle attributes.
 However, the expression of either will promote expression of another MRF,
 myogenin, which marks the transition form specification to differentiation.
 MRFs share structural features, and some are juxtaposed in the genome,
 making their study difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initiation of myogenin expression marks the transition from specification

 In humans, by the seventh week of gestation, the initial wave of myoblast
 fusion slows down, and a second proliferative stage starts.
 The latter tapers off, leading to formation of secondary myotubes, within
 the same laminar sheath with a primary myotube.
 Around the seventeenth week, some secondary myotubes migrate to form independen

 at other ages.
 Overall, muscle formation in children appears qualitatively different from
 adult muscle hypertrophy and regeneration, and should be more susceptible
 to modulation via mitotic mechanisms.
 This may be underlie a difference between juvenile and adult in the atrophying

 In contrast, after feeding, oversupply of NEFA is compensated mainly by
 increased uptake, in absolute terms, in the visceral adipose tissue, with
 minor contributions from other adipose tissue, liver, and muscle.

Muscle work is generated at such high rates, that most glucose is processed
 solely through glycolysis, in the cytosol, to the three-carbon pyruvate.
 Some of the pyruvate is further oxidized in the muscle, through the tricarboxyl
ic acid cycle, but a significant amount is converted to lactate and released
 in the blood stream.
 As part of the Cori cycle, circulating lactate is reassembled into glucose
 by the liver, and re-released into the blood stream, for muscle use.
 A similar shuttling mechanism further enables muscle to rely on glycolysis,
 by transaminating excess pyruvate to the amino acid alanine, similarly
 released in the blood.
 Circulating alanine is converted by liver to glucose.
 Pyruvate transamination requires the amino acid glutamate.
 Muscle uses glutamate for other metabolic processes, including the synthesis
 of non-essential amino acids, including proline and arginine.
 Therefore, at rest, human muscle uptakes significant amounts of glutamate,
 less serine, while releasing alanine, glutamine, and smaller amounts of
 the other amino acids
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "gelfand1986removal"

 Glutamine is synthesized in muscle in order to release the excess nitrogen
 yielded by amino acid release during protein degradation.
 Muscle's glutamine is then converted by the liver to urea and excreted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Among the amino acids with a trend for release between meals, isoleucine,
 leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine cannot be synthesized
 by humans.
 Their net release indicates that, at rest, basal level of protein degradation
 slightly surpass protein synthesis.
 Conversely, for a steady muscle mass, there must be net protein synthesis
 in the fed state.
 Feeding status is relayed to the muscle by a surge in insulin and, independentl
y, by an increase in circulating levels of essential branched-chain amino
 acids (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "BCAA"
description "branched-chain amino acids"

), that is, valine, isoleucine, and leucine.
 The signaling effects of BCAA are not completely understood.
 Some studies show that BCAA ingestion or infusion increase protein synthesis
 rate

 However, staying true to their energetic value, BCAA supplementation caused
 increases in insulin in all the referenced studies.
 It becomes difficult to extricate BCAA intrinsic effect from that of insulin.
 Moreover, the combination of insulin and BCAA is a potent synergistic anabolic
 stimulus in healthy human muscle

 In young, healthy controls, BCAA alone were able to increase the fractional
 synthesis rate for myofibrilar protein.
 At the same time, BCAA caused an increase in phosphorylation of mechanistic
 target of rapamycin (

 This posttranslational modification is caused by the ribosomal protein

 Indeed, in the same muscle, p70-S6K was activated, as indicated by an increase
 in its Threonine-389 phosphorylated form.
 Another substrate of mTOR complex 1, eukaryotic translation initiation

 The action of mTOR complex 1 on 4E-BP is the canonical way in which the
 former stimulates protein synthesis, by abolishing the latter's ability

 Quy found that mTOR complex 1 activation is lost upon proteasome inhibition
 with bortezomib.
 One can hypothesize the existence of an mTOR negative regulator which is
 specifically targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system during denervation.
 However, the late timing of the Akt / mTOR involvement suggests that the
 most plausible explanation places mTOR activation after the proteasome
 releases significant amounts of free amino acids.
 It is therefore more likely that denervation-induced mTOR activation is
 caused by the proteasome-stimulated amino acid release.

\begin_layout Standard
Establishing the role for mTOR complex 1 in denervation-induced loss of
 muscle mass is crucial.
 In conceptual frame before Quy and Tang experiments, mTOR complex 1 was
 thought as being inactivated by denervation, thus downregulating on protein
 synthesis and removing a restriction on autophagy.
 This hypothesis was conceptually attractive, because it implied a co-operation
 between multiple anabolic and catabolic pathways, towards achieving muscle
 loss.
 In particular, denervation-induced autophagy appealed to the muscle biologists
 of the 2000's.
 For example, in a never-replicated experiment, one group claimed that the
 lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine prevents denervation-induced muscle loss

 Others showed that denervation upregulates lysosomal enzyme cathepsin L

A similar debate surrounds protein synthesis regulation in denervation.
 In Goldberg's 1969 experiment, the specific activity of the remaining muscle
 protein was essentially the same as in control limbs.
 Increased or even unchanged protein synthesis rates would have caused a
 reduction in specific activity.
 Therefore, Goldberg concluded that denervation causes protein synthesis
 decreases, thus opening a debate that is still unsettled.
 Goldberg's observed reduction in protein synthesis rate is consistent with
 an indiscriminate loss of translation initiation and elongation factors,
 as much as with an active mechanism of protein synthesis cessation.
 Moreover, more recent functional studies, including some from Goldberg's
 group, found that denervation stimulates translation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Unlike the 1969 study, contemporary studies measured protein synthesis
 rate directly and over shorter time intervals (hours, rather than weeks).
 As in the case of autophagy, follow-up studies found molecular changes
 in regulators of translation, in some cases supporting a regulated, denervation
-triggered mechanism of protein translation shutoff, in others refuting
 them.
 Both Tang and Quy found that denervation causes increased phosphorylation
 of 4E-BP, thus leading to stimulation of protein synthesis.
 Both also show that the effect on 4E-BP is prevented by rapamycin, demonstratin
g that protein synthesis is upregulated through an mTOR-dependent mechanism.

Given that rapamycin has essentially no effect on adult muscle mass

, it may be that mTOR is not the crucial effector of denervation-induced
 muscle loss once thought.
 Recent studies show that its activation, and the downstream net anabolic
 effects it elicits through autophagy and translation, cannot explain the
 observed phenotype.
 Denervation-induced muscle loss is, to great extent, produced by the ubiquitin-
proteasome system.
 Better experiments are needed in order to understand autophagy and of mTOR
 in denervation-induced muscle loss.
 The irreconcilable differences between functional and molecular studies
 of denervation epitomize similar predicaments in the study of muscle atrophy
 due to other etiologies, including the less-explored GAML.

Many published studies documents the effect of Dexa on the mouse cell line
 C2C12 and the rat cell line L6.
 However, these and other myogenic cell lines have significant limitations,

 As mentioned earlier, in the case of primary cells, experiments with Dexa
 are outright impossible, because primary cell survival is GC-dependent.
 Moreover, Dexa has hyperplastic and hypertrophic effects on myogenic cell

 Nevertheless, the same studies report that Ser 473 sensitivity to insulin

 Mutagenic abolition of Ser 473 phosphorylation abrogates Akt activity on

 This suggests that mTOR complex 2 modulates Akt specificity rather than
 its activity, although similar results would be seen if specificity does
 not change, but FoxO substrates are relatively scarcer than tuberin / GSK3.
 An alternative hypothesis is based on the fact that non-mutagenic in vivo
 experiments failed to find circumstances when Akt is activated in the absence
 of Ser 473 phosphorylation (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "manning2007akt/pkb"

).
 This suggests that in vivo Ser 473 may be a requirement for Thr 308 phosphoryla
tion.
 In the absence of better experiments, the concerted Dexa-imposed changes
 in Ser 473 and Thr 308 may be ascribed to either Ser 473 epistasis, or
 to parallel PI3K-triggered pathways.
 Both imply that Dexa-induced Akt modulation must involve Ser 473.
 Since Ser 473 sensitivity to insulin is depressed by Dexa, Dexa may cause
 intermittent suppression of Akt, especially after feeding.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In conclusion, the muscle response to GC is associated with molecular changes
 consistent with Akt / mTOR loss of sensitivity to trophic factors such
 as insulin and IGF-I.
 Based on p70-S6K divergence, it appears that GC causes Akt-mediated mTOR
 modulation, in contrast with denervation atrophy, where Akt is downstream
 of mTOR.
 Interestingly, the pathway appears largely unaffected by Dexa in basal
 conditions, when trophic factors are withheld.
 It may be the case that mTOR-mediated mechanisms of GAML become relevant
 during episodes of hyperinsulinemia, such as after feeding.
 For always-on, feeding-independent GAML to proceed, mTOR-independent are
 also required.
 Because all our knowledge about Akt pathway in GAML is derived from experiments
 with intrinsic anabolic interventions, it may not be correct.
 Experiments on transgenic mice, unpicking one putative mediator at a time,
 may invalidate the current model of GAML, as they did in denervation atrophy.

\begin_layout Standard
In a model where C2C12 cells are treated with Dexa, they proliferate less
 (rather unusually), downregulate protein synthesis, and upregulate protein
 degradation (all by tracer).
 (PMID: 8791198).
 T has no significant effect on any of these.
