Muscles are specialized for their main ability, contractility.
 For mammalians, ability to move is vital for survival, meaning that a large
 portion of their bodies is muscle.
 In a cohort of 300 borderline overweight US Americans, skeletal muscle
 as a proportion of body weight was on average 41% for men and 31% for women
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Owing to the ability to measure individual muscles in any experiment, the
 scientific community has not been under pressure to develop accurate techniques
 that measure total skeletal muscle mass in mice.
 A proxy measure of murine skeletal muscle mass, lean body mass averaged
 81% of total body weight in adult males (detailed in results section).
 Three fifths of the human body's protein is confined to the muscle contractile
 and support structures

\begin_layout Standard
For the most part, the skeletal muscles confers the three-dimensional intricate
 conformation of the body, suggesting a complex, detailed organization,
 at least at macroscopic level.
 In contrast, at cell level, the relatively high specialization of the skeletal
 muscle leaves little space for diversity or inhomogeneity.
 Skeletal muscles are organized in anatomical units that may impose a force
 on two moving body segments (typically, bones), determining them to come
 closer to each other.
 This specificity of action is ensured by the presence of distinct, well-determi
ned insertion points, to which skeletal muscles are attached by the means
 of tendons and aponeuroses (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "mescher2013junqueiras"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tendons are dense connective tissue structure, which extend into the
 epimysium, a connective tissue sheath surrounding the muscle.
 In turn, epimysium emits connective septing structures termed perimysium,
 splitting muscles into subunits termed fascicles.
 At an even lower level, a thin, sparse connective structure called endomysium
 coats each polynucleate, elongated cell (termed myofiber).
 Connective tissue supports the terminal branches of the nervous, circulatory
 and lymphatic systems.
 In addition, connective tissue inside the muscle provides mechanical anchoring
 between fibers, longitudinally, laterally and with the tendons.
 This is particularly true of perimysium, whose collagen content is 95%
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "light1984characterization"

\end_inset

.
 The collagen in muscle-associated connective tissue is mainly of types
 I and III (reticulin), with traces of type V collagen and fibronectin,
 while the most frequent proteoglycan is collagen I-binding decorin
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "eggen1994decorin"

\end_inset

.
 The external lamina is the equivalent of basement membranes in other tissues,
 an proteic structure surrounding each multinucleate, roughly tubular cell.
 The external lamina contains collagen IV, laminin, and heparan sulfates
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "grounds2005strength,mann2011aberrant"

\end_inset

.
 Muscle mass changes should require remodeling of all these connective structure
s, with novel collagen synthesis possibly misleading measurements of protein
 synthesis in atrophying muscle.
 In addition to the contractile and connective components, muscles include
 vascular, nervous, adipose, blood and immune cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The myofiber is the histological base unit of contractile tissue.
 Another muscle-specific population of cells comprises the mononuclear,
 proliferating cells, called satellite cells.
 Satellite cells are nearly devoid of cytosol, sitting in close proximity
 to the fiber, under the external lamina.
 They can be identified by markers such as Pax7 and, on the membrane, CD34
 (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "scharner2011muscle"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each myofiber is a syncytium, that forms and grows by fusion with neighboring
 cells.
 The only way to acquire nuclei to the myofibers is fusion with surrounding
 proliferative mononucleate cells, or with neighboring myofibers.
 Cells that have the ability to undergo mitosis and to fuse with myofibers
 are typically designated myoblasts.
 In vivo, myoblasts are derived from a subset of satellite cells.
 Experimentally, α7 integrin is an effective marker for selecting proliferative
 precursors from muscle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "blanco-bose2001purification"

\end_inset

, although its sensitivity and specificity are yet to be established.
 Alternate sources of nuclei in the myofiber are subject of ongoing research,
 but their relative importance is expected to be minor at best (reviewed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A transplant of seven satellite cells from an adult mouse is capable of
 yielding more than a hundred multinucleate myofibers, thus demonstrating
 former's ability to regenerate muscle
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The transformation of quiescent satellite cells to proliferating myoblast
 is regulated by the interplay of growth factors, external lamina, and contact
 with myofibers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bischoff1986proliferation"

\end_inset

.
 In vivo, myofiber nuclei are typically peripheral, while in vitro incomplete
 models often yield elongated, contractile cells, with central nuclei, akin
 to regenerating fibers.
 The latter are typically termed myotubes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proliferative niche can play an important role in muscle atrophy and
 recovery.
 However, muscle hypertrophy may occur without cell divisions.
 For example, the muscles of mice receiving clenbuterol and of rats undergoing
 eccentric training gain 20-30% muscle mass without apparent DNA changes

 Quail muscles depleted of proliferating cells by irradiation still undergo
 hypertrophy in response to stretch-overload
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 These example of amitotic hypertrophy demonstrate that, in some circumstances,
 the number of nuclei and the pace of transcription are not limiting factors
 in muscle growth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large majority of the myofiber cytosol is the contractile apparatus, in
 the shape of bundles of protein filaments termed myofibrils.
 Within myofibrils, myosin and actin filaments alternate, held together
 by multi-protein complexes containing titin.
 Myofibril proteins are about two thirds of the total myofiber protein
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "waterlow1978protein"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, any myofiber size change with functional relevance should correlate
 with changes in myosin II and actin protein content.
 In rat muscles, three days of streptozotocin-induced acute diabetes causes
 intramuscular formation of a actin degradation fragment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 The apparent sensitivity of actin to muscle mass regulators poses a technical
 challenge to protein and even mRNA measurements, because traditionally
 actin is considered a housekeeping, unregulated, and rather constant protein,
 and is used in level normalization.
 If, in an atrophying muscle, some protein of interest is depleted faster
 than actin, immunoblots will convey the certainty that the former is downregula
ted.
 But if the protein of interest is lost in a less preferential manner, at
 the same rate with actin, immunoblots normalized to actin will convey the
 mistaken appearance of constancy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar issues govern the use of 3MH as a marker for myofibril protein catabolis
m.
 Given that the main correlate of urinary 3MH is muscle mass
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lukaski1981relationship"

\end_inset

, 3MH measurement may lack sensitivity when used as a indicator for muscle
 catabolic rate.
 On one hand, increased catabolism is expected to cause increased 3MH output,
 but on the other, an atrophic muscle has less 3MH to release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During experiments that perturb muscle mass equilibrium, the level of the
 regulators, of typical housekeeping proteins, and of non-myofiber proteins
 may fluctuate in manners that convolve their specific modulation with overall
 muscle protein kinetics.
 Investigation of recovery from muscle loss is burdened by the fact that
 it aims to dissect protein regulation, when the regulators are proteins
 themselves.

Around puberty, muscle growth is associated with a massive shift of nuclei
 from the satellite cells to the myofibers
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Even earlier, de novo muscle development is remarkable for its accretion
 of new nuclei to the myofiber.
 Pre-adulthood muscle growth appears reliant on hyperplasia, that is, cell
 proliferation.
 Cell proliferation regulators are crucial in determination of muscle mass
 in before and soon after birth.

) database, there is no reported case of human mutation of Myf5 or MyoD,
 further supporting the idea of duplicate function.
 Neither Myf5, nor MyoD induce muscle attributes.
 However, the expression of either will promote expression of another MRF,
 myogenin, which marks the transition form specification to differentiation.
 MRFs share structural features, and some are juxtaposed in the genome,
 making their study difficult.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initiation of myogenin expression marks the transition from specification

 In humans, by the seventh week of gestation, the initial wave of myoblast
 fusion slows down, and a second proliferative stage starts.
 The latter tapers off, leading to formation of secondary myotubes, within
 the same laminar sheath with a primary myotube.

 Overall, muscle formation in children appears qualitatively different from
 adult muscle hypertrophy and regeneration, and should be more susceptible
 to modulation via mitotic mechanisms.
 This may be underlie a difference between juvenile and adult in the atrophying

 In contrast, after feeding, oversupply of NEFA is compensated mainly by

Muscle work is generated at such high rates, that most glucose is processed
 solely through glycolysis, in the cytosol, to the three-carbon pyruvate.
 Some of the pyruvate is further oxidized in the muscle, through the tricarboxyl
ic acid cycle, but a significant amount is converted to lactate and released
 in the blood stream.
 As part of the Cori cycle, circulating lactate is reassembled into glucose
 by the liver, and re-released into the blood stream, for muscle use.
 A similar shuttling mechanism further enables muscle to rely on glycolysis,
 by transaminating excess pyruvate to the amino acid alanine, similarly
 released in the blood.
 Circulating alanine is converted by liver to glucose.
 Pyruvate transamination requires the amino acid glutamate.
 Muscle uses glutamate for other metabolic processes, including the synthesis
 of non-essential amino acids, including proline and arginine.
 Therefore, at rest, human muscle uptakes significant amounts of glutamate,
 less serine, while releasing alanine, glutamine, and smaller amounts of
 the other amino acids
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Glutamine is synthesized in muscle in order to release the excess nitrogen
 yielded by amino acid release during protein degradation.
 Muscle's glutamine is then converted by the liver to urea and excreted.

Among the amino acids with a trend for release between meals, isoleucine,
 leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, and valine cannot be synthesized
 by humans.
 Their net release indicates that, at rest, basal level of protein degradation
 slightly surpass protein synthesis.
 Conversely, for a steady muscle mass, there must be net protein synthesis
 in the fed state.
 Feeding status is relayed to the muscle by a surge in insulin and, independentl
y, by an increase in circulating levels of essential branched-chain amino
 acids (

 Indeed, in the same muscle, p70-S6K was activated, as indicated by an increase

 effects (for example,

 Recent studies contradicted this paradigm.
 In 2013, Quy and colleagues found that denervation increased Thr 389 phosphoryl
ation and catalytic activity of p70-S6K, indicating that denervation causes
 in fact activation of mTORC1
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 In 2014, Tang and colleagues proved that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1
 which lacks intrinsic anabolic properties, abolishes denervation-induced
 loss of muscle mass
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "tang2014mtorc1"

\end_inset

.
 These experiments prove that mTORC1 should be activated for denervation-associa
ted muscle atrophy to proceed in its later stage.
 Tang showed that denervation causes phosphorylation of insulin receptor
 substrate (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

) 1, proving that, in denervation, activated mTORC1 inhibits Akt through
 a p70-S6K - IRS 1-mediated negative feedback loop.
 Quy found that mTORC1 activation is lost upon proteasome inhibition with
 bortezomib.
 One can hypothesize the existence of an mTOR negative regulator which is
 specifically targeted by the ubiquitin-proteasome system during denervation.
 However, the late timing of the Akt / mTOR involvement suggests that the
 most plausible explanation places mTOR activation after the proteasome
 releases significant amounts of free amino acids.
 It is therefore more likely that denervation-induced mTOR activation is
 caused by the proteasome-stimulated amino acid release.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Establishing the role for mTORC1 in denervation-induced loss of muscle mass
 is crucial.
 In conceptual frame before Quy and Tang experiments, mTORC1 was thought
 as being inactivated by denervation, thus downregulating on protein synthesis
 and removing a restriction on autophagy.
 This hypothesis was conceptually attractive, because it implied a co-operation
 between multiple anabolic and catabolic pathways, towards achieving muscle
 loss.
 In particular, denervation-induced autophagy appealed to the muscle biologists
 of the 2000's.
 For example, in a never-replicated experiment, one group claimed that the
 lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine prevents denervation-induced muscle loss
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Others showed that denervation upregulates lysosomal enzyme cathepsin L

A similar debate surrounds protein synthesis regulation in denervation.
 In Goldberg's 1969 experiment, the specific activity of the remaining muscle
 protein was essentially the same as in control limbs.
 Increased or even unchanged protein synthesis rates would have caused a
 reduction in specific activity.
 Therefore, Goldberg concluded that denervation causes protein synthesis
 decreases, thus opening a debate that is still unsettled.
 Goldberg's observed reduction in protein synthesis rate is consistent with
 an indiscriminate loss of translation initiation and elongation factors,
 as much as with an active mechanism of protein synthesis cessation.
 Moreover, more recent functional studies, including some from Goldberg's
 group, found that denervation stimulates translation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "goncalves2012clenbuterol,quy2013proteasome-dependent,gomes2012upregulation,joshi2014differential,furuno1990role"

\end_inset

.
 Unlike the 1969 study, contemporary studies measured protein synthesis
 rate directly and over shorter time intervals (hours, rather than weeks).
 As in the case of autophagy, follow-up studies found molecular changes
 in regulators of translation, in some cases supporting a regulated, denervation
-triggered mechanism of protein translation shutoff, in others refuting
 them.
 Both Tang and Quy found that denervation causes increased phosphorylation
 of 4E-BP, thus leading to stimulation of protein synthesis.
 Both also show that the effect on 4E-BP is prevented by rapamycin, demonstratin
g that protein synthesis is upregulated through an mTOR-dependent mechanism.

Given that rapamycin has essentially no effect on adult muscle mass

, it may be that mTOR is not the crucial effector of denervation-induced
 muscle loss once thought.
 Recent studies show that its activation, and the downstream net anabolic
 effects it elicits through autophagy and translation, cannot explain the
 observed phenotype.
 Denervation-induced muscle loss is, to great extent, produced by the ubiquitin-
proteasome system.
 Better experiments are needed in order to understand autophagy and of mTOR
 in denervation-induced muscle loss.
 The irreconcilable differences between functional and molecular studies
 of denervation epitomize similar predicaments in the study of muscle atrophy
 due to other etiologies, including the less-explored GAML.

For large animals, cats, or dogs, practical and humane reasons prevailed,
 meaning that data about muscle mass changes are often lacking.
 For many of these species, the genome was not known, and specific antibodies
 are not manufactured, meaning that signaling pathways could not be dissected.
 Especially in the early years, studies did not record most relevant outcomes,
 such as muscle mass and / or force, putting into question their validity.
 In the era of genome sequencing, studies of GAML focused on mice and rats.
 Muscle mass in mice is smaller, making dissection harder and changes closer
 to detection threshold, compared to rats.
 It is unclear whether mouse studies are further complicated by additional
 resistance to GAML compared to rats.

 Moreover, Dexa has hyperplastic and hypertrophic effects on myogenic cell

 A sizable body of indirect evidence suggests that the main positive regulator
 of atrogenes in GAML are FOXO transcription factors.
 These transcription factors are reliably upregulated by Dexa in muscle.
 In addition, Dexa inhibits their kinase, Akt, thus protecting them from
 ubiquitination and degradation.
 Atrogenes are also modulated by myostatin, through SMAD3 transcription
 factor, and by AMP-activated protein kinase (

 Transgenic mice with a defective GR still exhibit upregulated atrogenes
 in denervation and fasting.
 Therefore, atrogenes integrate a multitude of GC-activated and GC-independent
 metabolic and hormonal signals (discussed in dedicated sections).

 The studies are interesting opening move in the field of epigenetics, and

 The fact that there is significant leeway for amplification of anabolic
 pathways demonstrates that, at basal state, muscle Akt-mediated signals
 are diminished.
 Unsurprisingly, investigations of muscle in basal state have been prone
 to fail to observe changes in Akt-related signals.
 Moreover, studies on the Akt pathway are conceptually challenged by the
 low basal activity.
 In order to prove causality by downstream inhibition, one must reverse
 that inhibition, and establish that the final effect is lost.
 Chemical reversal of inhibition is rarely an option.
 In the case of Akt, genetic reversal of inhibition, that is, overexpression
 studies, have minute chances of matching wildtype basal level.
 Most often, overexpression of IGF-I, IGF-1R, Akt, or other mediators of
 GAML overcompensates Dexa's effect, and causes overriding, possibly non-specifi

 It is unclear whether the difference between in vivo and in vitro studies
 of mTORC1 substrates is caused by the use of different anabolic stimuli.
 Whereas in vivo studies use insulin to elicit an Akt response whose modulation
 by GC is measurable, in vitro studies commonly use IGF-I (for example,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 One reason could be the remarkable hyperplastic abilities of insulin

While Akt repression is consistent with the induction of the ubiquitin-proteasom
e system via FOXO, its side effect, mTOR repression, is expected to lead
 to simultaneous downregulation of protein synthesis via 4E-BP (discussed

 In vivo evidence for mTOR-mediated autophagy upregulation in GAML is indirect

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on p70-S6K divergence, it appears that GC causes Akt-mediated mTOR
 modulation, in contrast with denervation atrophy, where Akt is downstream
 of mTOR.
 However, an unreplicated recent study opens the perspective for a paradigm-over
turning situation.
 In an acute study of Dexa on female rates, Britto and colleagues confirmed
 most of the current model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "britto2014redd1"

\end_inset

.
 Dexa repressed mTORC1 activity, as indicated by lower phosphorylation of
 its substrate 4E-BP1.
 The repression of mTORC1 was correlated with an reduced inactivation of
 the negative regulator PRAS40.
 In contrast, and unexpectedly, acute Dexa increased TSC2 phosphorylation,
 indicating that Dexa induces substrate selectivity changes in Akt.
 As discussed earlier, such Akt selectivity are attributed to dissociation
 between Ser 473 and Thr 308 phosphorylation state.
 Indeed, Britto and colleagues found that, after acute Dexa, phosphorylation
 at Ser 473 increases, while at Thr 308 it decreases.
 This is a rare, although not unique, account of Akt hyperphosphorylation
 in GAML.
 In each case, these findings may be explained by the particular conditions
 of the unique experiment.
 Here, proteolysis was not unaltered, indicating that acute Dexa is not
 a true model of GAML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Britto and colleagues refined their model by observing the effect of Dexa
 in REDD1 knockout mice.
 REDD1 depletion abolishes GAML, although atrogenes are still upregulated.
 On the other hand, REDD1 depletion prevents Dexa's hypophosphorylating
 action on 4E-BP1 and p70-S6K.
 These findings place mTORC1 inhibition at the core of GAML.
 Britto and colleagues propose a model of GAML where Ser 473 hyperphosphorylatio
n is caused by an mTORC1 feedback loop being severed by Dexa.
 Upstream of mTORC1, REDD1 knockout mice exhibit loss of phosphorylation
 on PRAS40 and Akt on Thr 308.
 While Akt remains upstream of mTOR and vital for GAML, Britto's model discards
 phosphorylation of Akt at Ser 473 and of TSC2 from the rapid REDD1-dependent
 response to Dexa.
 Multiple studies in transformed cells confirm the role of Thr 308 in REDD1
 repressive action on mTOR, while proposing different intermediaries (

While it is certain that GAML is correlated with mTORC1 downregulation,
 it is still unclear how mTORC1 repression is achieved, and what is its
 relative importance.
 Based on the evidence published until now, the recent change of paradigm
 which placed p70-S6K at the forefront of denervation atrophy appears unlikely
 in GAML.
 For now, our understanding of GAML places Akt firmly upstream of mTORC1.
 Better transgenic models, a deeper understanding of mTOR pathways and more
 in vitro / recombinant experiments are required for a definitive conclusion.

The evidence for the role of Foxo in GAML is not as direct and compelling

The importance of Foxo transcription factors is supported intuitively by

 Multiple mechanisms converge to induce Foxo upregulation in GAML.

First, Foxo transcription factors are thought to be potentiated by Dexa
 through post-translational means involving the earlier described Akt pathway
 (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "calnan2008foxo"

\end_inset

).
 Akt phosphorylates Foxo1 at Tyr 32 and Ser 253, thus creating binding sites
 for 14-3-3.
 Phosphorylated Foxo transcription factors are exported from the nucleus,
 and eventually marked for ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation.
 It is believed that the Dexa-induced impairment of Akt contributes to an
 increase in their activity in GAML.
 Given that phosphorylated Foxo is degraded and is elicited by a low-activity
 Akt pathway, Foxo phosphorylation changes may be undetectable in basal
 state.
 In C2C12 myotubes, Foxo phosphorylation downregulation in response to Dexa
 is more readily detected

 1969 study on cortisone-induced atrophy of rat muscle brought one more
 important theme for the field of GAML.
 In that experiment, the specific activity, that is, the ratio between tracer
 and total protein, was the same in GC-treated muscle as in control animals,
 despite decreased muscle mass and decreased total tracer in the GC-treated
 group.
 Goldberg conjectured that an equal rate of protein synthesis in the two
 groups would have caused a faster dilution of the tracer in the GC-treated
 muscle.
 Failing to find that was interpreted as evidence for decreased protein
 synthesis in cortisone-treated muscle.
 This was an elegant way of bypassing the denominator effect from the typical
 experiments, where synthesis rate would be measured over hours, in muscles
 that already underwent atrophy in the prior days.
 In these cases, a loss in protein synthesis rate might be underestimated

 Overexpression of eIF3-f causes hypertrophy, and eIF3-F knockout induces

 reductions in the rate of protein synthesis.
 Moreover, further data from the same group shows that loss of eIF3-f impairs
 the ability of mTOR to bind and phosphorylate p70-S6K, suggesting that
 eIF3-f pro-anabolic action is more complex

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 While the use of non-fusing myoblasts is certain to introduce confounding
 changes in proliferation, and the equivalence between IGF-I and insulin
 lacks subtlety, his hypothesis captured the attention of many investigators.
 As described in the sections on Akt and mTOR, most of the knowledge we
 have about it is derived from studies of anabolism, where muscle, rather
 than being analyzed in its basal state, is first stimulated with insulin
 or IGF-I.
 Lately, the interpretation of such experiments shifted from mechanism-explainin
g to a therapeutic paradigm.
 Systemic co-administration of IGF-I reduces loss of muscle mass, fiber
 atrophy, and 3MH release

A major atrophic action of Dexa on muscle is desensitisation of the Akt/mTOR
 axis, with loss of anabolism and gain in catabolism, and mimicking a relative

 of IGF-I
